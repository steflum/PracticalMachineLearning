##Overview

This repository contains files pertaining to the class project/assignment for the Coursera Practical Machine Learning class offered by Johns Hopkins University. This class is the 8th class in the Data Science specialization certification series offered by Coursera. This class is taught primarily by Jeff Leek.

##Assignment

Using data obtained by Groupware@LES (http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har), observations from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbbell of 6 participants were obtained as they performed barbell lifts. The 6 participants performed the lifts correctly and incorrectly 5 ways.  

From the assignment instruction page:  

>The goal of your project is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise. This is the "classe" variable in the training set. You may use any of the other variables to predict with. You should create a report describing how you built your model, how you used cross validation, what you think the expected out of sample error is, and why you made the choices you did. You will also use your prediction model to predict 20 different test cases.  

After this report has been submitted, it will be peer review and graded by those who are also taking this course. The final result of the prediction model on the test set is also submitted to a quiz that is automatically graded for accuracy of the final model.
